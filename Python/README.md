# 🐍 Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

**Author:** Prateek Waghmare

## 📌 Overview
This section of the repository contains **Python implementations** of core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Each folder is organized by data structure type, with numbered `.py` files for step-by-step learning.  

The code is:
- **Well-documented** with headers for purpose, category, and description.  
- **Standalone** — run any file directly using `python filename.py`.  
- **Organized** for learners to progress from basic to intermediate challenges.
