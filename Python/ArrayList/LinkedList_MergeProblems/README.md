# Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists – Practice Problems

This folder contains practice problems for learning how to **re-link nodes** in a linked list instead of creating new nodes.  
The focus is on solving different variations of the classic "merge two sorted linked lists" problem.

## Files
- **merge_core.py** → Core implementation (`Node`, `merge`, `printAndTraverse`).
- **problem1.py** → Merge two sorted linked lists.
- **problem2.py** → Merge two lists where one is empty.
- **problem3.py** → Merge two lists where all elements of one are smaller.
- **problem4.py** → Merge two lists of different lengths.
- **problem5.py** → Merge when both lists have duplicate elements.

## Learning Outcome
- Understand how to **re-link existing nodes** instead of creating new ones.
- Handle edge cases (empty lists, duplicates, different lengths).
- Build confidence with linked list manipulations.
