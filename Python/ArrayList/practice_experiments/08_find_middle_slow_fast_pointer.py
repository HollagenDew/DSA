# üìÅ File: 08_find_middle_slow_fast_pointer.py
# üìå Purpose: Find the middle element of a singly linked list using slow and fast pointers
# üìö Category: Linked List ‚Äì Intermediate Level (Challenge #8)
# üß† Description:
#   - Uses Floyd's slow and fast pointer technique
#   - üê¢ 'slow' pointer moves one step at a time
#   - üêá 'fast' pointer moves two steps at a time
#   - When 'fast' reaches the end, 'slow' will be at the middle

# üß© Node class to represent each element in the linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # üíæ Store the node's value
        self.next = None  # üîó Pointer to the next node

# üìú Utility function to print the linked list
def traverseAndPrint(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.data, end=" -> ")
        current = current.next

# üéØ Function to find the middle element using slow and fast pointers
def findMiddleElement(head):
    slow = head   # üê¢ Pointer that moves one step
    fast = head   # üêá Pointer that moves two steps

    # ‚è© Loop until fast reaches the end of the list
    while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
        slow = slow.next         # ‚û°Ô∏è Move slow pointer by 1
        fast = fast.next.next    # ‚è≠Ô∏è Move fast pointer by 2

    return slow.data  # üéØ The slow pointer is now at the middle node

# --- Example Execution ---

# üõ†Ô∏è Create linked list: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> 60 -> 70 -> 80 -> null

node8 = Node(80)

node1.next = node2
node2.next = node3
node3.next = node4
node4.next = node5
node5.next = node6
node6.next = node7
node7.next = node8

# üì§ Display linked list
print("Linked List:")

# üîç Print middle element
print("Middle Element of the Linked List is:", findMiddleElement(node1))
